# Non_ELS_San_Fire_Mega_Pack

Thake You For Downloading!!!

These liveries are based off of California Department of Forestry & Fire Protection, or more commonly known as Cal Fire. These aren't my vehicles, I only made the liveries, and changed the light colors, and patterns for all of them. Credits to the original versions are linked down below.

/////Light Patterns\\\\\

Since this pack is based off of Cal Fire, all vehicles must abide by the California emergency vehicle regulations. Red steady burns were added to at least one of the front-facing lights on every vehicle. this is because according to California Vehicle Code Sec. 25252.5., "Every authorized emergency vehicle is required to have one steady burning red lamp that is visible from 1000 feet. California Vehicle Code Sec. 25252. These vehicles may also have a revolving flashing or steady light system on the upper beam headlamps that alternates from one side to the other..." Obviously Cal Fire is an authorized emergency response team with authorized emergency vehicles.
